It will speficially highlight the vegetation damage through false color imagery (part 1) and explore internet availability of census blocks affected by the fires (part 2).\n\n*Complete code for the analyses can be found in the following Github repositories:* [part 1](https://github.com/sofiasarak/eds220-hwk4); part 2\n\n## Overview \n\nThe Eaton and Palisades fires occurred nearly simultaneously, inflicting both ecological and infrastructural damage on Los Angeles. Together, they destroyed more than 16,000 structures and displaced thousands of households. Understanding the specifics of the impact -- such as which populations were most affected as well as the extent of vegetation damage -- is vital for recovery efforts, as well as informing future fire safety and policy.\n\nWe overlay the fire perimeters onto to remote sensing and Environmental Justice Index (EJI) data to explore the patterns within in. First, by using remote sensing data and assigning infrared bands to visible colors, we are able to highlight vegetation health, burn severity, and the extent of fire scars remnant after the fire. Second, clipping EJI census block data to the fire perimeters gives us a summary of the internet availability in each area. Internet availability is an important aspect of fire safety response as communities that lack availability to natural disaster information have less time to respond.\n\n### Analysis Highlights: \n\n1. **Using `xarray` and NetCDF data formats.** Our primary dataset comes from landsat, and must be read in using the `xarray` package.\n2. **Plotting raster data as false color.** The combination `.plot.imshow` ensures that our raster image plots, arguments like `robust` ensure accurate plotting, and selecting reflectance bands other than true color are important steps to the process.\n3. **Clipping raster data to a polygon.** `geopandas` functionality is used to accurately clip EJI data to our area of interest.\n\n### About the data:\n\n**Landsat/remote sensing**\n\nThe dataset used in this analysis is a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite. Landsat data is provided by a series of Earth-observing satellites jointly managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and stores a significant amount of reflectance information about the Earth's surface.\n\nThe data was retrieved from the [Microsoft Planetary Computer data catalogue](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2) catalogue and clipped to an area surrounding the fire perimeters by the [EDS220](https://meds-eds-220.github.io/MEDS-eds-220-course/) course team. Accessed November 15, 2025.\n\n**Palisades and Eaton fire perimeter**\n\nPalisades and Eaton fire perimeter data were sourced from [LA County's GIS hub](https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/maps/ad51845ea5fb4eb483bc2a7c38b2370c/about). It contains dissolved fire boundaries for Eaton and Palisades fires. It is a public data set, published January 21, 2025 and last updated on February 26, 2025. Accessed November 15, 2025.\n\n**EJI**\n\ndescribe\n\n\n## Analysis\n\n### False Color Image\n\n#### Setup\n\n::: {#46195df6 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport os\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport xarray as xr\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Fire Perimeter Data Exploration\n\nBefore we utilize our fire perimeter datasets, we want to ensure that we have a general sense of what they contain and how they look.\n\n::: {#0c98306d .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Read in data, using os to build file path and geopandas to read in .shp files (one for each fire)\n\n# Eaton perimeter\nfp = os.path.join('data','Eaton_Perimeter_20250121','Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.shp')\neaton_perimeter = gpd.read_file(fp)\n\n# Palisades perimeter\nfp = os.path.join('data','Palisades_Perimeter_20250121','Palisades_Perimeter_20250121.shp')\npalisades_perimeter = gpd.read_file(fp)\n```\n:::\n\n\nData loaded in successfully!\n\n::: {#200b758a .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Plot perimeter data to visualize its contents\n\n# Initialize figure with two axes (so can plot each perimeter on a separate plot)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows = 1, ncols = 2, figsize = (6,4))\n\n# Plot Eaton fire perimeter on the left //.boundary allows access to just the border of the polygon\neaton_perimeter.boundary.plot(ax = ax[0])\n\n# And the Palisades fire perimeter on the right\npalisades_perimeter.boundary.plot(ax = ax[1])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=513 height=203}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we have a preliminary understanding of what our datasets contain: geometries of each fire perimeter.\n\nTo find the CRS of the two datasets (which will inform how we treat them with plotting other data), we can explore the following.\n\n::: {#0c6ec3a4 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# What is the CRS?\nprint(f\"The CRS of the Eaton fire perimeter data is {eaton_perimeter.crs}.\")\nprint(f\"The CRS of the Palisades fire perimeter data is {palisades_perimeter.crs}.\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe CRS of the Eaton fire perimeter data is EPSG:3857.\nThe CRS of the Palisades fire perimeter data is EPSG:3857.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat! They match, and we will keep this information in mind when we plot with our raster data.\n\n#### Landsat (NetCDF) Data Import and Exploration\n\nSimilarly to our fire perimeter data, we want to read in our remote sensing data and take a look at its features, such as dimensions, variables, and attributes. We are using `xarray` in this case.\n\n::: {#040d4815 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Read in data, using os to build file path\nfp = os.path.join('data', 'landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc')\n\n# a. Import landsat data using `xr.open_dataset()` from the xarray library\nlandsat = xr.open_dataset(fp, engine=\"netcdf4\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nInclude exploration stepts\n\nThis data currently has no geographic information, however it is stored within the `spatial_ref` variable. We can restore it by doing the following.\n\n::: {#375c0abe .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Access CRS through `spatial_ref` variable\n# .crs_wkt specifies that our CRS was stored in the well-known text format\nlandsat_crs = landsat.spatial_ref.crs_wkt\n\n# Recover and reassign geospatial info through .write_crs\nlandsat_geo = landsat.rio.write_crs(landsat_crs)\n\n# Print new CRS info\nprint(f\"The CRS of the landsat raster data is {landsat_geo.rio.crs}.\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe CRS of the landsat raster data is EPSG:32611.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### False Color Image\n\nFalse color images use colors not found in visible light, such as infrared, which are assigned to different bands of the visible light spectrum (RGB). This helps us visualize phenomenom that can be observed with reflectance patterns, but not by the human eye.\n\nHere, we create a false color image by plotting the short-wave infrared (swir22), near-infrared, and red variables (in that order). We do this because those three wavelengths are useful in determining vegetation health. Then, we can overlay our fire perimeters to explore differences between affected and untouched areas.\n\nFirst, we want to make sure our geographic information matches.\n\n::: {#a44f8602 .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Changing fire perimeter data to the landsat CRS ; sourced from original exploration, where landsat_crs = 'epsg:32611'\neaton_perimeter = eaton_perimeter.to_crs(landsat_crs)\npalisades_perimeter = palisades_perimeter.to_crs(landsat_crs)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, we can plot them all together!\n\n**Note:** To plot a raster image, we select the bands we want to plot in RGB order from the dataset using `[[]]`. The method `.plot.imshow(robust = True)` is used to plot. `imshow()` is helpful for rasters as it tells the \"image to show\", and the argument `robust = True` indicates to only plot values from the 2nd to 98th percentile. This helpful avoid outliers that are results of inaccurate or incorrect data (for example: 0 or very high values that correspond to cloud cover), and can skew the appearance of the image, sometimes inhibitting it from plotting at all.\n\n::: {#fa007895 .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Initialize figure with one axes\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (9,5))\n\n# Plot false color raster image by selecting which bands we want to assign\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True,\n                                                           ax = ax)\n\n# Plot the Eaton fire perimeter\neaton_perimeter.boundary.plot(ax = ax,\n                              color = \"red\",\n                              linewidth = 1.5,\n                              label = \"Fire Perimeter\")             # Set label to create legend for fire perimeter\n\n# Plot the Palisades fire perimeter\npalisades_perimeter.boundary.plot(ax = ax,\n                                  color = \"red\",\n                                  linewidth = 1.5)\n\n# Add labels to distinguish between Eaton and Palisades boundaries\n# .set_bbox() creates background for text (for better visibility)\nax.text(x = 402400, y = 3779000, s = \"Eaton\", color = \"black\", fontsize = 8).set_bbox(dict(facecolor='white', alpha = 0.8, edgecolor = 'none'))\nax.text(x = 345000, y = 3775000, s = \"Palisades\", color = \"black\", fontsize = 8).set_bbox(dict(facecolor='white', alpha = 0.8, edgecolor = 'none'))\n\n# Turn of x and y axis (are in meters, so don't tell give us a lot of information)\nax.axis('off')\n\n# Plot title and description\nplt.title(\"Los Angeles County, Post January 2025 Fires (False Color Image)\")\nplt.figtext(x = 0.5, y = 0, s= \"Description: False color imagery, overlayed with known fire perimeters, \"\n                                \"is used to highlight the effects of wildfires on LA county.\" \\\n                                \" By plotting short-wave infrared (swir22), near-infrared, and red reflectance bands,\" \\\n                                \"we are able to observe the stark contrast in features such as vegetation health and burn severity throughout the area.\",\n            ha=\"center\", fontsize=10, wrap=True)\n\n# Add legend (for fire perimeters)\nplt.legend()\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-9-output-1.png){width=875 height=455}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have a false color image with the fires highlighted, we can see the difference in vegetation health between areas within and outside the fire perimeters.\n\n### Internet Availability \n\nLoad in EJI data using `geopandas`.\n\n::: {#0c52afcf .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\neji = gpd.read_file(\"data/EJI_2024_California/EJI_2024_California.gdb\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Polygon Clipping\n\nThe EJI dataset is a raster spanning all of California.
