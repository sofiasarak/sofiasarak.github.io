    "text": "During her undergraduate career, she conducted research in an evolutionary biology lab, specializing in morphometric analysis to determine minnow species’ genetic variation. Additionally, she was an intern for Harbor Watch at Earthplace, a Connecticut-based nonprofit where she learned urban water quality management skills, both in field and lab settings. Sofia’s undergraduate studies culminated with the completion of a capstone experience in which she explored trophic levels of ant species in Puerto Rico. She graduated from Wesleyan University in 2025 with degrees in Earth & Environmental Sciences and Economics.\nSofia has also studied at the University of Otago in New Zealand and La Universidad de San Francisco de Quito on the Galapagos Islands. These experiences allowed her to explore the fields of marine science and ecology as well as data visualization and communication on an international level.\nWith past roles having shaped her passion for the environment and its conservation, she is hoping to apply her data science skills to projects of a greater scale. Sofia is particularly interested in exploring environmental change over time, especially in the marine context."
