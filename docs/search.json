The use of the gamma and segmented statistical models aims to confirm or deny the presence of a break-point at which a potential relationship between invertebrate and water trace-element concentrations changes.\nResults such as these have the potential to influence policy decisions regarding water ecosystem rehabilitation, signficant after years of mining and industry pollution in the area."

    "text": "Clark Fork Basin Data\nThis data set is sourced from the USGS National Water Information System database. It contains trace-element concentration values of water, sediment, and species of small invertebrates (caddisflies and stone flies) along the tributaries of the Clark Fork Basin, Montana (collected in July 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaddisflies are freshwater insects, spending their larval stage in freshwater bodies of water. (Image Source: Shuttershock)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClark Fork Basin tributaries in Montana, where data for the subsequent analysis was collected. (Image Source: USGS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater, bed sediment, and invertebrate tissue were sampled in streams that contain trace elements associated with historical mining and smelting activities. Large-scale mining and smelting were prevalent in the basin for more than 100 years but are now either discontinued or reduced in scale. Current (as of 2020) land uses are primarily cattle production, logging, mining, residential development, and recreation.\nConcern about the toxicity of trace elements to the aquatic ecosystem and human health has resulted in a comprehensive monitoring effort by State, Federal, Tribal, and private entities to characterize the aquatic resources in the Clark Fork Basin. This effort was designed to guide and monitor remedial activities and to evaluate the effectiveness of remediation and cleanup.\nSampling methods for the three elements can be found in the original report. In this analysis, we use three elements that were tested across water, sediment, and invertebrate tissue, in an effort to explore the impact of water contamination level on the ecology and food systems of the area.\nTrace-element concentration in water is treated as the main predictor variable for trace-element concentration in invertebrate tissue. This relationship was determined based on past research which used element accumulation in aquatic larvae as an indicator for water quality (Haas & Pánik 2025, Pastorino et al. 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Directed Acyclic Graph depicting the relationship between our variables of interest.\n\n\n\nSediment concentration acts as a source of trace-element concentration, as it stores and has the potential to release it back into water over the long term (Horowitz 1991). Species may have an effect on trace-element accumulation as it can introduce differences in metabolic function, but this will not be explored in this analysis.\n\nData Exploration\nThe following figures are useful to visualize the similarities and differences in distribution of trace-elements across the three sinks (water, sediment, and invertebrate tissue) tested, as well as provide a quick overview of the range that each trace-element spans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that copper and lead have similar distributions between all three sinks, but on widely different scales (sediment holds the most, tissue the second most, and water the least). Arsenic has a wider distribution in water than in sediment and invertebrate tissue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the axes of our plots, we can see that all of our trace-elements exist at varying ranges of concentration in both water and invertebrate tissue. Generally, there appears to be a visual positive relationship (perhaps less so in lead).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the previous figure, we can come to the conclusion that trace-elements occur at different scales. The visual positive relationship between sediment and invertegrate tissue is more obvious across trace-elements than between water and invertebrate tissue."

    "text": "Why Gamma and Segmented/Breakpoint Models?\n\nModel 1: Segmented\nThe segmented/break-point (or sometimes referred to as broken-line) statistical model is a regression analysis where the relationship between the response and one or more predictor variables contain a break-point at which the relationship between the response and predictor variables changes. This sort of model is common in fields such as epidemiology, occupational medicine, toxicology, and ecology, where it is of interest to assess threshold value where the effect of the covariate changes.\nWe will will use model in our analysis to explore whether their is a threshold value(s) at which the relationship between trace-element concentration in water and trace-element accumulation in invertebrates changes.\nTo test this analysis on simulated data, we can do so by feeding it data that has a known break-point, such as that below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo follow the steps of a segmented model, we first apply a linear regression model to the data, then the segmented model.\n\n# Run lm model on data\nsample_model_seg_1 &lt;- lm(data = sample_data, y~x)\n\n# Run segmented model on lm (note: function comes from the R package \"segmented\")\nsample_model_seg_2 &lt;- segmented(sample_model_seg_1, seg.Z = ~x)\n\nIf we were successful, the summary should return an estimated breakpoint at x = 50.\n\n# Does it return a break-point of 50?\nsummary(sample_model_seg_2)$psi\n\n       Initial Est.

It is appropriate for data that contains continuous variables that are always positive and have skewed distributions. Our data matches this description, as trace-element concentrations are never negative (and our data contains no values of 0), and higher concentrations occur less frequently than lower ones.\nThe gamma distribution is made up of the parameters shape and scale, which relate to the mean and variance of the data through the following formulas.\nTo test this analysis on simulated data, we can do so by feeding it data that has a known gamma distribution, simulated using the rgamma function. We can then confirm that our analysis worked by returning the shape and scale of the gamma model (related to dispersion, formulas below), and seeing if they match.\n\nm &lt;- 50 # true mean\nv &lt;- 25  # true variance\nsimulated_data &lt;- data.frame(y = rgamma(n = 100, shape = (m^2)/v, scale = v/m))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- glm(y ~ 1, \n          data = simulated_data,\n          family = Gamma(link = \"identity\"))"

Our results that arsenic and copper both contain break-point values at which their accumulation in invertebrate tissue changes in rate based on their concentrations in water. In arsenic this change is a positive one, whereas in copper the relationship levels off. We found no significant relationship between lead concentration in water and invertebrate tissue.\nIn terms of habitat remediation, recommendations based on these results could include paying particular attention to arsenic concentrations in the water."

    "text": "Overview\nThe Eaton and Palisades fires occurred nearly simultaneously, inflicting both ecological and infrastructural damage on Los Angeles. Together, they destroyed more than 16,000 structures and displaced thousands of households. Understanding the specifics of the impact – such as which populations were most affected as well as the extent of vegetation damage – is vital for recovery efforts, as well as informing future fire safety and policy.\nWe overlay the fire perimeters onto to remote sensing and Environmental Justice Index (EJI) data to explore the patterns within in. First, by using remote sensing data and assigning infrared bands to visible colors, we are able to highlight vegetation health, burn severity, and the extent of fire scars remnant after the fire. Second, clipping EJI census block data to the fire perimeters gives us a summary of the internet availability in each area. Internet availability is an important aspect of fire safety response as communities that lack availability to natural disaster information have less time to respond.\n\nAnalysis Highlights:\n\nUsing xarray and NetCDF data formats. Our primary dataset comes from the NASA/USGS Landsat program, and must be read in using the xarray package.\nPlotting raster data as false color. The combination .plot.imshow ensures that our raster image plots, arguments like robust ensure accurate plotting, and selecting reflectance bands other than true color are important steps to the process.\nClipping raster data to a polygon. geopandas functionality is used to accurately clip EJI data to our area of interest.\n\n\n\nAbout the data:\nLandsat/remote sensing\nThe dataset used in this analysis is a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite. Landsat data is provided by a series of Earth-observing satellites jointly managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and stores a significant amount of reflectance information about the Earth’s surface.\nThe data was retrieved from the Microsoft Planetary Computer data catalogue catalogue and clipped to an area surrounding the fire perimeters by the EDS220 course team.\nPalisades and Eaton fire perimeter\nPalisades and Eaton fire perimeter data were sourced from LA County’s GIS hub. It contains dissolved fire boundaries for Eaton and Palisades fires. It is a public data set, published January 21, 2025 and last updated on February 26, 2025.\nEnvironmental Justice Index (EJI)\nEJI aims to summarize the cumulative impacts of environmental injustice by census tract in the United States. The index considers 36 different environmental, social, and health factors, with data from a variety of sources (including but not limited to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Geological Survey, and OpenStreetMap). The data in this analysis was sourced from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry."

Now we can plot them to visualize what we are working with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have a preliminary understanding of what our datasets contain: geometries of each fire perimeter.\nTo find the CRS of the two datasets (which will inform how we treat them with plotting other data), we can explore the following.\n\n# What is the CRS?\nprint(f\"The CRS of the Eaton fire perimeter data is {eaton_perimeter.crs}.\")\nprint(f\"The CRS of the Palisades fire perimeter data is {palisades_perimeter.crs}.\")\n\nThe CRS of the Eaton fire perimeter data is EPSG:3857.\nThe CRS of the Palisades fire perimeter data is EPSG:3857.\n\n\nGreat! They match, and we will keep this information in mind when we plot with our raster data.\n\n\nLandsat (NetCDF) Data Import and Exploration\nSimilarly to our fire perimeter data, we want to read in our remote sensing data and take a look at its features, such as dimensions, variables, and attributes. We are using xarray in this case.\n\n# Read in data, using os to build file path\nfp = os.path.join('data', 'landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc')\n\n# Import landsat data using `xr.open_dataset()` from the xarray library\nlandsat = xr.open_dataset(fp, engine=\"netcdf4\")\n\nLet’s take a look at the xarray object itself.\n\nlandsat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;xarray.Dataset&gt; Size: 78MB\nDimensions:      (y: 1418, x: 2742)\nCoordinates:\n  * y            (y) float64 11kB 3.799e+06 3.799e+06 ... 3.757e+06 3.757e+06\n  * x            (x) float64 22kB 3.344e+05 3.344e+05 ... 4.166e+05 4.166e+05\n    time         datetime64[ns] 8B ...\nData variables:\n    red          (y, x) float32 16MB ...\n    green        (y, x) float32 16MB ...\n    blue         (y, x) float32 16MB ...\n    nir08        (y, x) float32 16MB ...\n    swir22       (y, x) float32 16MB ...\n    spatial_ref  int64 8B ...xarray.DatasetDimensions:y: 1418x: 2742Coordinates: (3)y(y)float643.799e+06 3.799e+06 ... 3.757e+06units :metreresolution :-30.0crs :EPSG:32611axis :Ylong_name :y coordinate of projectionstandard_name :projection_y_coordinatearray([3799050., 3799020., 3798990., ..., 3756600., 3756570., 3756540.])x(x)float643.344e+05 3.344e+05 ... 4.166e+05units :metreresolution :30.0crs :EPSG:32611axis :Xlong_name :x coordinate of projectionstandard_name :projection_x_coordinatearray([334410., 334440., 334470., ..., 416580., 416610., 416640.])time()datetime64[ns]...[1 values with dtype=datetime64[ns]]Data variables: (6)red(y, x)float32...grid_mapping :spatial_ref[3888156 values with dtype=float32]green(y, x)float32...grid_mapping :spatial_ref[3888156 values with dtype=float32]blue(y, x)float32...grid_mapping :spatial_ref[3888156 values with dtype=float32]nir08(y, x)float32...grid_mapping :spatial_ref[3888156 values with dtype=float32]swir22(y, x)float32...grid_mapping :spatial_ref[3888156 values with dtype=float32]spatial_ref()int64...crs_wkt :PROJCS[\"WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N\",GEOGCS[\"WGS 84\",DATUM[\"WGS_1984\",SPHEROID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"7030\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"6326\"]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"8901\"]],UNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"4326\"]],PROJECTION[\"Transverse_Mercator\"],PARAMETER[\"latitude_of_origin\",0],PARAMETER[\"central_meridian\",-117],PARAMETER[\"scale_factor\",0.9996],PARAMETER[\"false_easting\",500000],PARAMETER[\"false_northing\",0],UNIT[\"metre\",1,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9001\"]],AXIS[\"Easting\",EAST],AXIS[\"Northing\",NORTH],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"32611\"]]semi_major_axis :6378137.0semi_minor_axis :6356752.314245179inverse_flattening :298.257223563reference_ellipsoid_name :WGS 84longitude_of_prime_meridian :0.0prime_meridian_name :Greenwichgeographic_crs_name :WGS 84horizontal_datum_name :World Geodetic System 1984projected_crs_name :WGS 84 / UTM zone 11Ngrid_mapping_name :transverse_mercatorlatitude_of_projection_origin :0.0longitude_of_central_meridian :-117.0false_easting :500000.0false_northing :0.0scale_factor_at_central_meridian :0.9996spatial_ref :PROJCS[\"WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N\",GEOGCS[\"WGS 84\",DATUM[\"WGS_1984\",SPHEROID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"7030\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"6326\"]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"8901\"]],UNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"4326\"]],PROJECTION[\"Transverse_Mercator\"],PARAMETER[\"latitude_of_origin\",0],PARAMETER[\"central_meridian\",-117],PARAMETER[\"scale_factor\",0.9996],PARAMETER[\"false_easting\",500000],PARAMETER[\"false_northing\",0],UNIT[\"metre\",1,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9001\"]],AXIS[\"Easting\",EAST],AXIS[\"Northing\",NORTH],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"32611\"]]GeoTransform :334395.0 30.0 0.0 3799065.0 0.0 -30.0[1 values with dtype=int64]Indexes: (2)yPandasIndexPandasIndex(Index([3799050.0, 3799020.0, 3798990.0, 3798960.0, 3798930.0, 3798900.0,\n       3798870.0, 3798840.0, 3798810.0, 3798780.0,\n       ...\n       3756810.0, 3756780.0, 3756750.0, 3756720.0, 3756690.0, 3756660.0,\n       3756630.0, 3756600.0, 3756570.0, 3756540.0],\n      dtype='float64', name='y', length=1418))xPandasIndexPandasIndex(Index([334410.0, 334440.0, 334470.0, 334500.0, 334530.0, 334560.0, 334590.0,\n       334620.0, 334650.0, 334680.0,\n       ...\n       416370.0, 416400.0, 416430.0, 416460.0, 416490.0, 416520.0, 416550.0,\n       416580.0, 416610.0, 416640.0],\n      dtype='float64', name='x', length=2742))Attributes: (0)\n\n\nFrom this output, we can see the five reflectance bands that our data has stored. We also see that there are three coordinates: x, y, and datetime. We now also know the size of our coordinates and the data type of each variable.\nWe can check the geographic information of our data using the rio accessor…\n\nprint('CRS: ', landsat.rio.crs)\n\nCRS:  None\n\n\n… but get nothing back. This is because this data currently has no geographic information, as it is stored within the spatial_ref variable. We can restore it by doing the following.\n\n# Access CRS through `spatial_ref` variable\n# .crs_wkt specifies that our CRS was stored in the well-known text format\nlandsat_crs = landsat.spatial_ref.crs_wkt\n\n# Recover and reassign geospatial info through .write_crs\nlandsat_geo = landsat.rio.write_crs(landsat_crs)\n\n# Print new CRS info\nprint(f\"The CRS of the landsat raster data is {landsat_geo.rio.crs}.\")\n\nThe CRS of the landsat raster data is EPSG:32611.\n\n\nSuccess!\n\n\nFalse Color Image\nFalse color images use colors not found in visible light, such as infrared, which are assigned to different bands of the visible light spectrum (RGB). This helps us visualize phenomenom that can be observed with reflectance patterns, but not by the human eye.\nHere, we create a false color image by plotting the short-wave infrared (swir22), near-infrared, and red variables (in that order). We do this because those three wavelengths are useful in determining vegetation health. Then, we can overlay our fire perimeters to explore differences between affected and untouched areas.\nFirst, we want to make sure our geographic information matches.\n\n# Changing fire perimeter data to the landsat CRS ; sourced from original exploration, where landsat_crs = 'epsg:32611'\neaton_perimeter = eaton_perimeter.to_crs(landsat_crs)\npalisades_perimeter = palisades_perimeter.to_crs(landsat_crs)\n\nThen, we can plot them all together.\nNote: To plot a raster image, we select the bands we want to plot in RGB order from the dataset using [[]]. The method .plot.imshow(robust = True) is used to plot.\nimshow() is useful for raster data as it tells the “image to show”, and the argument robust = True indicates to only plot values from the 2nd to 98th percentile. This helps to avoid outliers that are results of inaccurate or incorrect data (for example: 0 or very high values that correspond to cloud cover), and can skew the appearance of the image, sometimes inhibiting it from plotting at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have a false color image with the fires highlighted, we can see the difference in vegetation health between areas within and outside the fire perimeters.\n\n\n\nInternet Availability\nLoad in EJI data using geopandas.\n\neji = gpd.read_file(\"data/EJI_2024_California/EJI_2024_California.gdb\")\n\n\nPolygon Clipping\nThe EJI dataset is a raster spanning all of California. To get it to only our area of interest (the fires), we can use the geopandas method .clip().\n\n# Transform both perimeters to have CRSs matching that of the EJI data \npalisades_perimeter = palisades_perimeter.to_crs(eji.crs)\neaton_perimeter = eaton_perimeter.to_crs(eji.crs)\n\nClipping:\n\n# First arg: what we want to clip; Second arg: what polygon we want to clip to\nclipped_palisades = gpd.clip(eji, palisades_perimeter)\nclipped_eaton = gpd.clip(eji, eaton_perimeter)\n\nTo ensure that our clipping was successful, we can plot our new clipped data with our fire perimeters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing EJI Data\nWe can select our variable of interest – internet availability – from the EJI data. We can take then plot our clipped eji datasets (clipped_eaton and clipped_palisades), and specify column = ['variable of choice'] to color each census block by socioeconomic information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, we can see that there are few census tract with a significant percentage of individuals who do not have internet access. The left-most census tract of the Eaton fire – colored in yellow – is perhaps of concern.\nWe can ask the question, why is internet availability lower there than in the surrounding areas? And, how did that affect their response to the LA fires?"
