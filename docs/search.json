My greatest experiences have been studying abroad on the Galapagos Islands and New Zealand, as well as a week spent doing field work in Puerto Rico. In my hometown community, I have worked as a water quality monitoring intern and volunteer at my local urban farm whenever I can. I also have roots in Eastern Europe (Latvia and Ukraine), and I often try to integrate those places into my coursework!\nFeel free to navigate around my website to see more about my field work, my abroad experiences, what I do for fun, and of course, my data science and all of the technical skills that come with it."
